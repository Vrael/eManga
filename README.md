#Overview
Mangapp is an Android application where you can read your favourites mangas. 

This application doesn't contain any manga by default. All mangas are loaded from public internet sources and they can be consulted from any browser. So you will need to use internet for a full experience. 

This app will search mangas instead of you and then it will display you them easily.

Mangapp is completely public and free. 

#Features

* A big library with many different mangas
* A section with latest chapters
* A history to resume the read from last point
* Special concern in a fast load for pages to guarantee the best experience
