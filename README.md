A manga reader for android.

The idea is the next. There are different tabs for different categories such as:

    1. New (Latest mangas or chapters. eg: all of last seven days)
    2. Library (all mangas)
    3. Read (mangas read in the past, history)
    4. Favourites

Each tab has a GridView with mangas or chapters in form of thumbnails, with a title and a image cover. User can click on thumbnail and starts to read the manga or chapter.

For a good experince in mangas load, there is a database from mangas information is loaded first. Then database will update from repositories of mangas and when this done, views will be updated.

The database ONLY stores links and some relevant information for choose the better site where download the current manga or chapter.
